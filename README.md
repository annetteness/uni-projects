This Java project is about cargo ships loading.
First, we create class Container, then we create subclasses of different types of containers
with general and also unique characteristics for these subclasses.
The task of this project is:
- to make hierarchy of containers and goods.
- to return 15 000 random containers filled with random goods.
- to write them in a .txt file
- to create a modern ship for containers loading with coordinated like Bay, Row and Tier for placing the containers.
- to read the 15 000 containers generated earlier from a file
- to load the containers according to mass distribution, as well as proper place (refrigerated containers need to be close to electricity, open-top should be above close-top, 20'should be placed in odd Bay, 40'containers should be placed in even Bay.
- to write the ship loading in manifest.txt file. The file should contain container unique number, its position in all coordinates (bay, row, tier), the container mass with loaded goods and the type of goods it's loaded with.
